## Dedicated Server Setup

### Background
`host_timescale` requires the use of `sv_cheats` on dedicated servers, which is obviously problematic.

To workaround this, the plugin will block all cheat commands while the map is active (unless `ware_cheats` convar is set to 1).

Optionally, the plugin will also partially strip cosmetics/non-melee weapons (`loadoutwhitelister_enable` convar) by default.
This is used as an optimization for high player servers, as constantly loading all cosmetics and weapons causes heavy lag.
The whitelister will only allow hat cosmetics, which is a good middleground for allowing some player customization while preventing big stutters.

### Installation
Make sure you have SourceMod installed. This is not covered here, there are plenty of guides online.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ficool2/TF2Ware_Ultimate/releases). Extract it into your `addons` folder.

The plugin will automatically enable and disable itself when it detects the map name contains `tf2ware_ultimate`.

### Configuration
TF2Ware Ultimate loads its settings from the `tf/scriptdata/tf2ware_ultimate` folder. These settings will be generated on first launch of the map, if not present already.

Admin commands are supported (see: `!ware_help` in chat for commands). Listen server hosts can also use these commands.

### Events
The following events are sent by the gamemode if you would like to catch them. 
The unused event `player_rematch_change` is repurposed to allow VScript -> SourceMod communication, please see `ListenerVScript` in `tf2ware_ultimate.sp` for an example.
